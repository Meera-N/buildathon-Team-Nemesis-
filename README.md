# {Management System of Safe Houses and Hospitals in Emergency Situations} - BUILDATHON
This project aims to design and develop an integrated system for managing safe houses and healthcare facilities during disaster scenarios. Safe houses, designated as emergency shelters providing food and shelter, will be networked with hospitals to ensure coordinated medical support. The system will have the following core features:

  1. Interoperability between Safe Houses and Hospitals:
    The platform will facilitate seamless communication between hospitals and safe houses. It will allow healthcare providers to track and
    deploy necessary medical resources and personnel to safe houses based on real-time data about the needs of people taking shelter.
  
  2. User Communication and Navigation:
    Individuals in disaster-affected areas will be able to communicate with the safe houses via the system, allowing them to request          shelter, food, or medical assistance. The system will also provide travel guidance for users to safely reach the nearest available        safe house.
  
  3. Resource Allocation and Monitoring:
    The system will manage the allocation of essential resources, such as food, water, medical supplies, and shelter availability. It         will also monitor the status of the safe houses and hospital capacities, dynamically adjusting resource distribution based on real-       time conditions.
  
  4. Disaster Preparedness and Response:
    The platform will serve as a critical disaster preparedness tool, helping local authorities coordinate relief efforts between 
    multiple safe houses and hospitals in the event of a natural disaster, disease outbreak, or other emergencies.

This solution will improve disaster response efficiency by ensuring proper healthcare and resource management in a fully integrated, user-accessible system.
